This is a batch file (.bat) script for a utility tool that includes a menu interface with various cleanup, backup, and management options. The script leverages commands like xcopy, tasklist, and taskkill to perform actions like:

  1. Cleaning up temporary files (system and user temp folders).
  2. Task management: Viewing running tasks, starting new processes, and killing tasks by name.
  3. Backup utilities:
       - Steam data backup.
       - Browser data backup (Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera (All versions), Microsoft Edge).
       - AppData backup (which can potentially take a long time).
  4. Bat to Exe Converter
  5. Fun
       - Fake error box (unclosable)
       - Text to Voice (delete temp files by your self)
    
  6. If you have any suggestions what esle I should add to this program, DM me on my Discord server (https://discord.gg/XU2r8ZCj79).

The script includes visual formatting with ASCII art and colors to improve the user experience in the command-line interface. It also features navigation logic, allowing users to interact with different tools by entering specific numbers corresponding to the tool options.
